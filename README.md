Aashania Antil, Chhavi Dhiman (2023)

The recent boom in publicly available face authentication (FA) system has brought forward the susceptibility of FA systems to different attack vectors, especially spoofing/presentation attacks. There has been a noticeable increase in the novelty, variety and complexity of spoofing attempts on FA systems. Recently, numerous strategies have been proposed, employing both traditional as well as deep learning approaches. However, generalized face spoofing detection has always proven itself as a challenging research hotspot. Here, we propose a multi-level ELBP texture and deep features based novel face anti-spoofing framework for face spoofing detection. Extensive experiments including intra-dataset and inter-dataset testing were performed on three challenging face anti-spoofing databases, namely Replay-Attack, CASIA FASD, and MSU-MFSD to validate the effectiveness of our proposed work. A comprehensive ablation study to analyze the effects of different color spaces and multi-level deep feature extraction is also discussed. The proposed approach is effective at resisting photo and video attacks. The same is confirmed by the experimental results, outperforming the other state-of-arts with competitive results for both intra and inter-dataset evaluation protocols.
